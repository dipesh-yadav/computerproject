                                        The paragraph begins with the time: When we were just a little baby. the first
                                        day when we cried but our mother, father, whole family and relatives smiled.
                                        Then slowly we learnt walking holding our mom's hand. As we fell on the ground
                                        while walking, the ground got beaten from the mom and we got support. We again
                                        stood up and started walking again. Then after few yearswe
                                        started going
                                        to
                                        school, made new friends and smiled with new faces. But the time has made us
                                        grow so
                                        much that
                                        now
                                        we are in class 9. But actually it is going well as like
                                        that
                                        of junior
                                        classes. Oh sorry this is what we tell in-front of others. But no, should i tell
                                        the
                                        truth? Ok
                                        let
                                        me tell the truth. Actually there is nothing like before. Like each day we are
                                        piled up with a lot of pressures. Before when we were small, just a child, child
                                        who just played
                                        without any
                                        worries
                                        and pressure of homework and study, those were good old days.
                                    <p id="2">&nbsp; But now when we are in class 9 our day is just going with the
                                        routine:
                                        wakeup
                                        at 4 or 5,
                                        do
                                        homework, study, go school, in school give test, practicals, do classwork, get
                                        scolded by our
                                        teacher, get home work, come home, again start to do hw and then again learn for
                                        the
                                        next days
                                        test,
                                        and someday dont even dare to sleep else you will get scolding. There is so much
                                        of pressure that
                                        now
                                        we are just busy with all those writings and test all the time like literally
                                        have
                                        forgotten the
                                        meaning of life or the term "enjoyment in life". Yes, I know you guys maybe
                                        thinking
                                        then : How
                                        every day? There is a day called Saturday, the day on which you get holiday. Ok
                                        so
                                        it is just
                                        named
                                        as Saturday for us and we are told that on this day you get holiday and enjoy.
                                        but
                                        for us it is
                                        not
                                        holiday. When saturday comes we get even more homework saying, "what will u do
                                        whole
                                        day?".</p>
                                    <p id="3">&nbsp; Literally this is the life right now we students are living.Each
                                        and every
                                        day, every
                                        minute
                                        we talk about the old days. We dive deep into those feelings of the old days
                                        and
                                        unknowingly
                                        fall
                                        tears remembering those. We again want to live that life. But then what can we
                                        do....life is not a
                                        car
                                        that has reverse gear. So each day holding these loads on our sprained shoulder
                                        we
                                        move on with
                                        so
                                        called smile on our face. We even dont have time to go and sit with our family
                                        and
                                        talk about
                                        something. There is no time to even refresh our mind because we just are in
                                        deep
                                        relationship
                                        with
                                        someone but sadly that someone is tests and worksheets.</p>
                                    <p id="4">&nbsp;
                                        So what should we do in this mere reality of we student's life where we are just
                                        packed in the
                                        packet of pressures?</p>
                                    <p id="5">&nbsp;
                                        Right now also while typing this I, the narrator, is thinking about my those
                                        days
                                        when I cried
                                        for
                                        the chocolates and when i climbed on to mom and father's back. Those were the
                                        true
                                        epitome of
                                        the
                                        life. Literally right now I am in the imagination of those days and am embraced
                                        with those feelings.
                                        Oh
                                        wow the tears
